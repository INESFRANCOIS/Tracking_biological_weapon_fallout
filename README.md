# Tracking biological weapon fallout

### Content 

In this website, you will find my independant project "Tracking biological weapon fallout" performed from october to december 2020 
for the second assessment of the module Programinig for Social Science during my first year in integrated MSc and PhD Data Analytics and Society 

Project: 
It is an awful day in Data city,  someone lets off a biological weapon on top of a building with bacteria which are deadly on contact. The aim of this
code is to build a model of the spread in order to know the location of bacteria.

The website contains three tabs: Home with the order of mission, UML and the Python codes for the script to run the program and for the Agent class with their descriptions.
There are three figures the UML, movement of bacteria according given probalities. 

### Run the program  
This Python code was written on the Spyder IDE with  Python version 3.8. In your command prompt, you can: (1) read the script of model: more Trackingbacteria.py,
(2) read the  script of the agent class: more bacteriaclass.py, (3) run the program: python Trackingbacteria.py and (4) test the program: python -m doctest -v bacteriaclass.py
